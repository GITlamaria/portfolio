      <h3 >Behavior</h3>
      <p>It's a myth that going outside is a requirement for feline happiness.  Playing regularly with a cat easily satisfies her stalking instinct, keeps her stimulated, and provides the exercise she needs to stay health and happy.</p>

      <h3>Health</h3>
      <p>Stress and anxiety often cause behavior problems in our pets. Stressed-out cats may have
litterbox problems or begin fighting with other pets. Anxious dogs may be destructive,
escape, urine mark, or simply pant and pace. </p>

      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <p>The most common cat behaviors include purring, grooming, kneading and climbing. But each cat will engage in these activities differently. Pay attention to your cat's behavior and determine what is “normal” for your cat so you can be aware of unusual behavior that may require a trip to the vet.</p>
      <p>It's a myth that going outside is a requirement for feline happiness.  Playing regularly with a cat easily satisfies her stalking instinct, keeps her stimulated, and provides the exercise she needs to stay health and happy.</p>
      <p>Stress and anxiety often cause behavior problems in our pets. Stressed-out cats may have
litterbox problems or begin fighting with other pets. Anxious dogs may be destructive,
escape, urine mark, or simply pant and pace. </p>
